# About this project

During this project I will be creating a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that you can play in your web browser. The application is going to ask two users to enter their marker of choice and then start the game. If at any point a user has three markers in a row, they win and the game ends and they will be asked if they want to play again. If at any point their is a tie, the game ends and they will be asked again if they want to go again.
